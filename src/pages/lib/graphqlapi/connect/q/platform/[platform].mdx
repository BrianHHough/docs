In this guide, you will connect your application code to the backend API using the Amplify Libraries. We will review how to install and configure Amplify Libraries.

Before you begin, you will need:
- An AWS AppSync API already set up. For guidance on how to build a GraphQL API, see [Designing a GraphQL API in AWS AppSync](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/designing-a-graphql-api.html)
- A frontend application set up. For instructions on setting up an app, see [Project Setup: Create your application](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/project-setup/create-application/q/platform/js/)
- [npm installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started)
- A data stack deployed and configured

[TODO]: # (Follow up on the following codegen section for better placement. May be shifted to a different section.)

## Use Amplify codegen to generate queries, mutations, and subscriptions 

Using the `amplify add codegen` command, you can add an AWS AppSync API that is created using the AWS console. If your API is in a different Region than your current Region, the command asks you to choose the Region. If you are adding codegen outside of an initialized Amplify project, provide your introspection schema named `schema.json` in the same directory that you make the add codegen call from. 

<Callout>

__Note:__ If you use the --apiId flag to add an externally created AWS AppSync API, such as one created in the AWS console, you will not be able to manage this API from the Amplify CLI with commands such as `amplify api update` when performing schema updates. You cannot add an external AWS AppSync API when outside of an initialized project.

</Callout>

```bash
amplify add codegen --apiId <apiId>
```
Executing this command will generate the queries, mutations, and subscriptions within the src/graphql folder.

## Install and configure the Amplify Libraries

Add the `aws-amplify` package to your app with `yarn` or `npm`. This is the main library for working with Amplify Libraries in your projects. This will include connecting your app with the GraphQL endpoint.

Add Amplify to your app with `yarn` or `npm`:

```bash
npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-react
```

In your app's entry point, specifically **App.js** (Expo) or **index.js** (React Native CLI), import and load the configuration file:

```javascript
import { Amplify, API, graphqlOperation } from 'aws-amplify';
import awsconfig from './aws-exports';
Amplify.configure(awsconfig);
```

If you are using `Angular`, `NextJS`, or `VueJS`, please review the following additional details for installing the Amplify Libraries:

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="Angular">

Inside the `amplify-app` directory, install the Amplify Angular Library and run your app:

```bash
npm install --save aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-angular

npm start
```

The `@aws-amplify/ui-angular` package is a set of Angular components and an Angular provider that helps integrate your application with the AWS Amplify Library.

**Angular CLI output warnings:** If you encounter optimization bailouts warnings using Angular 9+ due to CommonJS or AMD dependencies, you can use this [gist](https://gist.github.com/wlee221/6d98d96740bea6f53327b4db4a432616) to remove them. See the [Angular website](https://angular.io/guide/build#configuring-commonjs-dependencies) for more details.

</Callout>

#### Strictly typing `aws-exports`

If you have TypeScript [strict mode](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#strict) on and see the error

```
Could not find a declaration file for module './aws-exports'. 'aws-exports.js' implicitly has an 'any' type.
```

Create a `aws-exports.d.ts` file on the same level as `aws-exports` with the following content:

```ts
declare const awsmobile: Record<string, any>
export default awsmobile;
```

#### Importing the Amplify Angular UI Module

Add the **Amplify Authenticator UI Module** to `src/app/app.module.ts`:

```ts
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

import { AmplifyAuthenticatorModule } from '@aws-amplify/ui-angular';

import { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    AppRoutingModule,
    /* configure App with AmplifyAuthenticatorModule */
    AmplifyAuthenticatorModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

The first step to using Amplify in the client is to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-react
```

The `aws-amplify` package is the main library for working with Amplify in your apps. The `@aws-amplify/ui-react` package includes React-specific UI components that you can use to build your app UI. To learn more about Amplify UI visit our [documentation](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/).

The first step to using Amplify in the client is to install the necessary dependencies:

<Block name="NPM">

```
npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-vue
```

</Block>

If you are using Vue 2, please check out our legacy [documentation](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ui/tree/legacy/legacy/amplify-ui-vue). For Vite installs check out this [documentation](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/vue/getting-started/installation#vite). 

</Callout>

The `@aws-amplify/ui-vue` package is a set of components that make it easy to integrate functionality like end-to-end authentication flows.

Well done! You now have your Amplify Libraries set up and configured.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have finished the **Connect your app code to the API** guide. In this guide, you reviewed the required configuration and installed and configured Amplify Libraries.

## Next steps

Our recommended next steps include using the API to mutate and query data. You can also review how to subscribe to real-time events to look for mutations in your data. Some resources that will help with this work include:
- [Create, update, and delete application data](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/graphqlapi/mutate-data/q/platform/js/)
- [Read application data](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/graphqlapi/query-data/q/platform/js/)
- [Subscribe to real-time events](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/graphqlapi/subscribe-data/q/platform/js/)
